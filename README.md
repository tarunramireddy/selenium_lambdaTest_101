How to run:
In the src code you can find package named TestScenarios and in that package there are four classes with three scenarios.
scenario-3 consists of two classes because when it is applied in internetExplorer 11.0 in windows-10 it is showing different message apart from remaining three capabailities.
There is pom.xml for maven dependencies because it is maven project.
Though we can run each class as a java project separately.
In gitpod inorder to obtain gitpod.yml we need to type command in the terminal- gp init
After creating gitpod.yml file we need to add steps using before,init & command or else can directly open in IntellijIdea rather on browser.
Thank you!
